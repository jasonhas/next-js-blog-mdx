I've always kinda considered myself a baseball guy. The World Series is by far my favorite sporting event. Love me some NCAA tournament time, but over the last few years the lack of quality referring has quickly killed that for me. However, today I find myself very excited that my Sunday's will now be filled with Football. 

Moving to the central time zone means that I get a little bit of my day back before the madness begins. It also means I get to crack a beer at tipoff and don't feel so bad ordering one instead of 10 am beers on Pacific Time. Life seemingly got a lot better

## So It begins
Fantasy Football is in full swing starting today.
