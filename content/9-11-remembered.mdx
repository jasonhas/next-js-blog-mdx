excerpt: "22 years ago today, I was on a plane headed to a client meeting in Los Angeles, traveling from my home in Longmont, Colorado. At this point in my career I was as seasoned traveler. However, halfway through this flight I realized something was wrong."

## Something Isn't Right
At this point in my life, I was traveling often for work. Travel was starting to take it's toll on me, as I had a pregnant wife, and we had just moved into a new home in Longmont Colorado, which was away from all of our family in California.

This particular week, I was headed to Los Angeles and had planned to stay with my parents while meeting with a hotel group in Los Angeles. The meeting location was across the street from LAX, none of us would have to travel far.

## Close To Home
Like I said, I love writing, or at least putting words down. I'm no literary genius and I expect fully to be in jail by the grahmar police. But hey, who cares.
